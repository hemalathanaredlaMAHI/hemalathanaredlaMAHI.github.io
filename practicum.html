        <h1 align="center"> Admission Portal </h1><br>
<div id="a">
        <p>
            I am doing the project on the admission portal. We are going to implement a project using react js. This is abou how me and my teammates worked on project weekly status.  

        </p>
        <h2>Week 1:</h2>
        <p>On the first day I installed <b>MYSQL,PHP and XAMPP</b> to run the previous code in the local host. Previous code is in the form of php. We need to implement the same format in <b>React Js</b>. After cloning the code from github I started running it in my system. While running it, in some places I got errors and rectified it. After that I have run the code successfully and understood the process, how it is working, how many components are there. 
            <br><br>
            Then mentor divided it into components and allocated each component for two members.My component was a <b>“Walk-in Application”</b>. I started understanding the code related to my component. First we need to know about the file's connection, so I started to create a use case diagram related to components. It helped me to understand where to start and where to end. First week I implemented the flow chart related to walk-in applications and gave a sprint review in saturday. 
            <br>
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1yj9-8qJfNiiQthn3tLRbP8Z3RMNaU0FnHJiPGuJpcmA/edit">Flow chart</a>
        </p><br><br>
        <h2>Week 2:</h2>
        <p>
            After completing the flow chart diagram, we implemented an algorithm based on walkin applications. In the algorithm we mentioned clearly about connection of files with file names and also mentioned which databases are used. After completing that I started to understand the code related to components. In that process I got some doubts related to code, so I searched it on google and asked a mentor to clarify it. In week 2  I also learned about <b>AJAX and Jquery</b> because it is also part of coding.
<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ArWorPBRCXjD5SZHMUNIaxyZ0pTTsQ1svGxfurkX4Gg/edit?ts=609a27a9">Algorithm</a>
        </p><br><br>

        <h2>Week 3:</h2>
        <p>
            We started working on implementing the front end part using <b>React Js</b> on <b>view profile, update profile, walking application, and payments</b>. First I worked on implementing the navigation bar to insert components in it. Then we started working on implementing the template on the right side with a particular shape. While implementing it we faced many difficulties like adjusting the shape for image, template shape, etc. After implementing the template we inserted fields related to profile and added edit button to edit profile. Implemented walking application front end part in next template with apply walking button, test center details. After implementing that we started working on the payment page with my payments details and pay online buttons. We adjusted all the styles and fonts related to all pages. 
<br><br>
In week 3 I learned some topics on React Js, because I am new to this topic. While doing the front end part, I searched related to work in google and implemented it in a project. Finnlay in that week we completed some front end parts with styling. 

        </p><br><br>
<h2>Week 4:</h2>
<p>

This week I started learning about FatAPI for backend development.  First I started learning basics about FastApi, basic syntax, how to write roots by using put and get methods. First I understood the sql database creation in fastapi and started implementing CRUD operations. After that I Started implementing the code for connecting the database and implemented create, get details from database. Then I implemented the update of the records in the database and deleted records from the database. One day I executed some examples related to path parameters, query parameters, body with multiple parameters, etc. Worked on updating the record based on one attribute, deleting the data based on one attribute. Finally I got a clear idea about crud operations in FastAPI.

</p><br><br>

<h2>Week 5:</h2>
<p>
  This week I worked on CRUD operations by connecting the MYSQL database using fastAPI. Then started working on connecting fastapi with reactJs and tried one sample example. After that I implemented the code for storing details in the database by taking it from the front end with get and post methods. I got a clear idea about gathering the details from the database and worked on the project. I worked on the login page where I was posting the details and checked whether login details are correct or not.  After checking it opens the view profile page if the user logs in for the first time. 

</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Week 6:</h2>
<p>
  This week I started working on the view profiles page. On that page we need to give details and store those details into the database. I successfully completed it. After storing the details it opens the dashboard and displays the user details. In that dashboard I worked on the edit button and stored that details in the database and displayed edited details in the dashboard.  After completing that I worked on walkin application, in that We need to select the centers and store those details into the database. I worked on that and displayed the table for every selection. Users can apply 3 times for walking, after completing the 3 times users cannot apply for walki. I worked on that and disabled the apply button after completing the 3 chances.
